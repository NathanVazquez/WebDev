# Mock Business Assignment

This Website is a photography company I want to work on through out the semester. Me and my partner are passionate about photography and I want to use this website to attract more clients. The goal for this first assignment was to build out a few pages of the website so I could practice my skills with Bootstrap and CSS

## Structure of the page

This website has 5 pages: waitlist.html, aboutus.html, contactus.html, photoalbums.html and index.html. I decided to split up this project to make it site look like other photography website

### index.html

This page shows off some photographs I have taken. I used the carousel container to contiously rotate and show all my photos to the viewer. There is a navbar to the other pages and a footer that takes you to the other pages.

### photoalbums.html

This page is still in development. This page will display all of our best photos organized into photo albums. We want the structure of the page to be pleasing to view and remind people of looking through photo albums. 

### contactus.html

This page will direct people to a simple form that collects their email, phone number, and message to us. All this information will be emailed to us and then a link to out calendly will appear so people can schedule a meeting to meet with us. Currently this only displays the form but the submit button doesn't email us the form. In the next two weeks I will add the JS script to make this possible.

### aboutus.html

This page includes portraits of me and my partner in this business. I also included a description of who we are and why we are a good choice for people.

### waitlist.html

The waitlist has a form that people can use to sign up to our newsletter. This will give people a way to stay in touch with us as we grow.
