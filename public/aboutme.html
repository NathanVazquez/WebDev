    <h3> Description of my ideal day </h3>
    <p>
        My ideal day begins around 8am. I want to wake up and see the glowing orange hue of the recent dawn. My ideal breakfast is half a muffin, a bowl of oatmeal, 
        assorted fruit, orange juice, eggs (scrambled) and a few suasage links. With a hardy breakfast, I will begin my day with a book in hand, something to keep me company on the train,
        as I depart to my first task, which will be the museum. I would pick a new museum I have yet to wander through or go to the MET ( my favorite museum). After a stroll through the musuem
        I would want to go somewhere less crowded, somewhere quiet. The perfect spot is the MET museum library. In the library I can look at the work of accomplished photographers and marvel at 
        their work. By this time it would be the late afternoon. Not yet twilight but it's approaching. I will take a stroll through central park to let my thought run loose. On my mind would be the 
        feeling of wind on my face, the many points in time I have vistied Central Park and how I felt at each of those points in my life. I would take look at my life at it's current stage and compare myself and my experiences
        to the ones in years prior. After see the sun fall and enjoying the shadows of twilight I would navigate to the train and goto 14 th st. From there I would start to walk in any direction. Searching for food and a place that is quite. One where I can pull out a book and read while eating my meal in the 
        silence of the restuarant. After I have eaten dinner I would leave to catch a movie. The movies are my ideal way to end the day. After seeing a movie that inspires emotion I feel relaxed enough to go to sleep.
